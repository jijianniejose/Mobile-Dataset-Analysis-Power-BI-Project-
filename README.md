## üìä Mobile Dataset Analysis (Power BI Project)
### üß† Project Overview

This Power BI project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis and visualization of a global mobile dataset, sourced directly from a SharePoint folder. It showcases a complete workflow from data acquisition and cleaning to advanced analytics, charting, and interactive reporting ‚Äî ideal for both data analysts and Power BI learners.

### üåê Data Source

Primary Source: Microsoft SharePoint Folder

Integration Tools: Power BI Desktop + Power Query

Supporting Tools: ChatGPT (for automated column cleaning, conversion table creation, and data insights)

Data Format: Excel and CSV datasets uploaded via SharePoint

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Workflow Steps

Data Connection

Created SharePoint site and connected it to Power BI

Loaded raw mobile dataset with multiple attributes (price, RAM, camera, processor, etc.)

Data Cleaning & Transformation

Removed duplicates and standardized text formats

Cleaned columns such as PKR price, RAM, and launch price

Created conversion factor table for USD, AED, PKR, INR, and CNY

Adjusted data types and added computed columns using DAX functions

Feature Engineering

Added slicers for model filtering (Company, Launch Year, Processor, RAM)

Created new metrics for average launch price and model count per brand

### Visualizations & Insights

Overview Page: Models by company, processor count, RAM distribution
